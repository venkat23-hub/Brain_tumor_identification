# Brain Tumor Identification and Classification Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain and can be life-threatening if not detected early. Manual analysis of MRI scans is time-consuming and highly dependent on expert radiologists. This project proposes an automated system for brain tumor identification and classification using deep learning techniques.

The system analyzes MRI images and classifies them into **tumor** and **normal** categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed approach improves accuracy, reduces human effort, and supports early diagnosis.
